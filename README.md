# IJC437 – PM2.5 Temporal Analysis in Sheffield

## Overview
This project analyses daily PM2.5 concentrations in Sheffield using open data
from the OpenAQ platform. The analysis focuses on temporal patterns and simple
time-based statistical models.

## Research Questions
1. How do daily PM2.5 concentrations vary over time in Sheffield during the study period?
2. Is there evidence that simple time-based models improve the explanation of daily PM2.5 concentrations compared to a baseline model?

## Files
